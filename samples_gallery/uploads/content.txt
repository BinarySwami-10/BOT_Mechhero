MAIN UPDATE:😅 (since i know i have a small audience , i had to click-bait you in here to make you read this)

Finally ! im extremely delighted to share that im ranked top 1 player , after 3 weeks of automation of the MMO Strategy game "Mech Hero", Backstory: earlier i posted about this game and my code on linkedin and github respectively. this time im top 1 player in 4 different categories (harvesting, offensive, merchant and infrastructure) and overall rank 1, its safe to say i cracked the game. read previous post to understand in detail.


i feel automation is the future. thank you for sparing your time to read .😀
